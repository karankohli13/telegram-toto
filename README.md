# telegram-toto
Simple bot for reading, writing, creating new messages in chats, in telegram. Does not create an individual account for the bot, but instead uses current user account to CRUD messages.


To run on your machine:

1. `npm i` OR `yarn` OR FOR MAXIMUM POWEER `pnpm i`
2. Rename `sample.config.js` file to `config.js`, replace `id` value with the APP_ID, `hash` with your APP_HASH.. and your `phone` number with of course, your personal number.
3. Finally run `npm run start` or `yarn start` or just `node index`!
4. If it works well, you should receive a confirmation code from Telegram ( in telegram ) and authenticate by typing it in the prompt that pops up.
